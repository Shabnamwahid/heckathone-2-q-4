# Phase I Research: Python CLI Best Practices 
## Overview 
This research document covers best practices for creating a command-line interface application in Python, focusing on the requirements for our In-memory Python CLI Todo App. 
## Python CLI Best Practices 
- Use clear and consistent menu prompts 
- Provide helpful feedback messages for user actions 
- Implement a main loop that continues until the user chooses to exit 
- Use functions to organize different operations 
- Follow the principle of least surprise for user interactions 
## In-Memory Data Structures in Python 
- Python dictionaries are ideal for storing key-value pairs like task ID and task details 
- Python lists can be used to maintain ordered collections of tasks 
- A combination of dictionaries and lists can provide flexible storage options 
- Consider using a list of dictionaries to store multiple tasks with multiple attributes 
- Use unique identifiers for each task to enable operations like update and delete 
## Python Input Validation Techniques 
- Use try-except blocks to handle potential errors when converting input types 
- Validate user input before processing to prevent errors 
- Check if task IDs exist before attempting operations on them 
- Use conditional statements to validate menu choices 
- Provide clear error messages when input validation fails 
## Python Best Practices for Todo App 
- Use meaningful variable and function names 
- Include docstrings for functions to explain their purpose 
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility 
- Use constants for values that don''t change 
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for code formatting
