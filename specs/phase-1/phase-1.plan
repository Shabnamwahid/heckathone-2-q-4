# Phase I Implementation Plan: In-memory Python CLI Todo App 
## Overview 
This plan outlines the implementation steps for the In-memory Python CLI Todo App based on the specifications defined in phase-1.spec. 
## Implementation Roadmap 
### Step 1: Project Setup 
- Create the main Python application file (todo_app.py) 
- Set up the basic project structure 
- Define constants and configuration variables 
### Step 2: Data Structure Design 
- Design the in-memory data structure to store tasks 
- Define the task model (ID, description, status) 
- Implement the storage mechanism using Python lists/dictionaries 
### Step 3: Core Task Functions 
- Implement add_task() function 
  - Accept task description as input 
  - Create a new task with unique ID and ''incomplete'' status 
  - Add task to the in-memory storage 
- Implement list_tasks() function 
  - Retrieve all tasks from storage 
  - Display tasks with ID, description, and status 
- Implement complete_task() function 
  - Accept task ID as input 
  - Update task status to ''completed'' 
- Implement delete_task() function 
  - Accept task ID as input 
  - Remove task from storage 
### Step 4: User Interface 
- Design the command-line interface 
- Create a menu system with options for each operation 
- Implement input validation for user commands 
- Add clear feedback messages for all operations 
### Step 5: Main Application Loop 
- Create the main application loop 
- Handle user input and route to appropriate functions 
- Implement exit functionality 
- Add error handling for invalid inputs 
### Step 6: Testing and Validation 
- Test all functionality against the validation criteria 
- Verify application starts and displays menu/prompt 
- Verify add, list, complete, and delete operations work correctly 
- Verify error handling for invalid inputs 
- Ensure application doesn''t crash during normal operation 
- Confirm code follows Python best practices 
## Timeline 
- Estimated completion: 1-2 days 
- Focus on functionality first, then code quality and user experience 
## Success Criteria 
- All requirements from the specification are implemented 
- Application meets all validation criteria 
- Code is well-structured and follows Python best practices 
- Application is stable and handles errors gracefully
