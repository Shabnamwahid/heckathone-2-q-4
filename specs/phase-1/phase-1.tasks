# Phase I Implementation Tasks: In-memory Python CLI Todo App 
## Overview 
This document outlines the specific implementation tasks for the In-memory Python CLI Todo App based on the specifications and implementation plan. 
## Detailed Task List 
### Task 1: Create Main Application File 
- Create the main Python application file named todo_app.py 
- Set up basic project structure with appropriate imports 
- Define constants and configuration variables 
### Task 2: Design In-Memory Data Structure 
- Design the in-memory data structure to store tasks 
- Define the task model with ID, description, and status fields 
- Implement the storage mechanism using Python lists or dictionaries 
### Task 3: Implement Add Task Function 
- Implement add_task() function 
  - Accept task description as input 
  - Create a new task with unique ID and ''incomplete'' status 
  - Add task to the in-memory storage 
### Task 4: Implement List Tasks Function 
- Implement list_tasks() function 
  - Retrieve all tasks from storage 
  - Display tasks with ID, description, and status 
### Task 5: Implement Complete Task Function 
- Implement complete_task() function 
  - Accept task ID as input 
  - Update task status to ''completed'' 
### Task 6: Implement Delete Task Function 
- Implement delete_task() function 
  - Accept task ID as input 
  - Remove task from storage 
### Task 7: Design Command-Line Interface 
- Design the command-line interface 
- Create a menu system with options for each operation 
- Implement input validation for user commands 
- Add clear feedback messages for all operations 
### Task 8: Implement Input Validation and Error Handling 
- Implement input validation for all user inputs 
- Add error handling for invalid inputs 
- Ensure application handles edge cases gracefully 
### Task 9: Create Main Application Loop 
- Create the main application loop 
- Handle user input and route to appropriate functions 
- Implement exit functionality 
### Task 10: Add User Feedback Messages 
- Add clear feedback messages for all operations 
- Provide confirmation messages for successful operations 
- Provide error messages for failed operations 
### Task 11: Test All Functionality 
- Test all functionality against the validation criteria 
- Verify application starts and displays menu/prompt 
- Verify add, list, complete, and delete operations work correctly 
- Verify error handling for invalid inputs 
- Ensure application doesn''t crash during normal operation 
## Requirements 
- All code must be generated via AI from specifications 
- No manual coding is allowed 
- Specifications are the single source of truth 
- All implementation must follow Python best practices 
- All work must stay inside the specs/phase-1/ folder until implementation phase
