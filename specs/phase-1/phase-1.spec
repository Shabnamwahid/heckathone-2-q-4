# Phase I Specification: In-memory Python CLI Todo App\n\n## Purpose\nDevelop a command-line interface todo application in Python that implements core todo functionality with in-memory storage. This phase establishes the foundational features of the todo application without persistent storage.\n\n## Requirements\n- Implement core todo functionality (add, list, complete, delete tasks)\n- Store data in-memory (no persistent storage)\n- Create an intuitive command-line interface\n- Focus on basic functionality and user experience\n- Support task creation with descriptions\n- Support listing all tasks with their status (completed/incomplete)\n- Support marking tasks as completed\n- Support deleting tasks\n- Handle user input validation\n- Provide clear feedback to users for all operations\n\n## Implementation Details\n- Use Python 3.x as the programming language\n- Implement as a command-line application\n- Store tasks in a Python data structure (list/dict) in memory\n- Use a simple menu system or command-based interface\n- Implement error handling for invalid inputs\n- Structure code with functions for each operation\n- Use a main loop to keep the application running until user exits\n- Consider using Python built-in libraries only (no external dependencies)\n\n## Validation Criteria\n- Application successfully starts and displays a menu or prompt\n- Users can add new tasks with descriptions\n- Users can list all tasks with clear status indicators\n- Users can mark tasks as completed\n- Users can delete tasks\n- Application handles invalid inputs gracefully\n- All functionality works as expected without crashes\n- Code follows Python best practices and is well-structured
