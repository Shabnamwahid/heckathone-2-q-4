# Phase I Implementation Checklist: In-memory Python CLI Todo App 
## Overview 
This checklist ensures all requirements for the In-memory Python CLI Todo App are met during implementation. Use this to verify completion of all necessary features and functionality. 
## Project Setup 
- [ ] Create the main Python application file named todo_app.py 
- [ ] Set up basic project structure with appropriate imports 
- [ ] Define constants and configuration variables 
## Data Structure Design 
- [ ] Design the in-memory data structure to store tasks 
- [ ] Define the task model with ID, description, and status fields 
- [ ] Implement the storage mechanism using Python lists or dictionaries 
## Core Task Functions 
- [ ] Implement add_task() function 
  - [ ] Accept task description as input 
  - [ ] Create a new task with unique ID and ''incomplete'' status 
  - [ ] Add task to the in-memory storage 
- [ ] Implement list_tasks() function 
  - [ ] Retrieve all tasks from storage 
  - [ ] Display tasks with ID, description, and status 
- [ ] Implement complete_task() function 
  - [ ] Accept task ID as input 
  - [ ] Update task status to ''completed'' 
- [ ] Implement delete_task() function 
  - [ ] Accept task ID as input 
  - [ ] Remove task from storage 
## User Interface 
- [ ] Design the command-line interface 
- [ ] Create a menu system with options for each operation 
- [ ] Implement input validation for user commands 
- [ ] Add clear feedback messages for all operations 
## Error Handling and Validation 
- [ ] Implement input validation for all user inputs 
- [ ] Add error handling for invalid inputs 
- [ ] Ensure application handles edge cases gracefully 
- [ ] Provide clear error messages when input validation fails 
## Main Application Loop 
- [ ] Create the main application loop 
- [ ] Handle user input and route to appropriate functions 
- [ ] Implement exit functionality 
## Validation Criteria 
- [ ] Application successfully starts and displays a menu or prompt 
- [ ] Users can add new tasks with descriptions 
- [ ] Users can list all tasks with clear status indicators 
- [ ] Users can mark tasks as completed 
- [ ] Users can delete tasks 
- [ ] Application handles invalid inputs gracefully 
- [ ] All functionality works as expected without crashes 
- [ ] Code follows Python best practices and is well-structured
